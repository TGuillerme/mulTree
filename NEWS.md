mulTree 1.2.4 (2016/08/10)
=========================

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Models memory management is now safer and is done only out of R environment leading to minor speed improvements in `mulTree` function.

mulTree 1.2.1 (2016/01/25)
=========================

### BUG FIXES
  * minor bug fix in `summary.mulTree` that can now deal with multiple hdr for each probabilities.

  * many functions arguments names have been modified, please check individual functions manual.
  * `rTreeBind` is renamed to `tree.bind`.
  * In `as.mulTree`, the argument `species` is now `taxa`.
  * `mulTree` output: when output chain name already exists in current directory, the function now asks if user wants to overwrite the existing files.
  * In `read.mulTree`, the argument `mulTree.mcmc` is now `mulTree.chain`.
  * In `summary.mulTree`, the argument `mulTree.mcmc` is now `mulTree.results` and the argument `CI` is now `prob`.
  * `summary.mulTree` now outputs a `c("matrix", "mulTree")` class object.
  * In `plot.mulTree`, the argument `mulTree.mcmc` must now be an object returned from `summary.mulTree`.
